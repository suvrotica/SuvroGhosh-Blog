	<h1 class={h1Style}>A Quixotic Blog</h1>
	<p class={pStyle}>
		Although flippant, this blog is a scratchpad of thoughts, a much-sought-after extension of my
		embarrassing tangle of nerves, unrelated fancies and figments strewn around and rattling loose
		in it, collectibles from the waste basket scraps that should have seen a shredder, or, somewhat
		more crudely, everything about anything. I'm not a prisoner to the usual boundaries that limit
		most people, and I wanted a place where the diarist in me could jot down the wanderings of his
		profligately traveling mind and not feel unwelcome. I presume I would leave the world richer in
		nonsense than anything of substance. But here I explore, when I still can, the vast and
		forbidden realms of human feats and foibles, fucks and farts, feces and fraternities. So whether
		you're a seasoned simulationist or a curious commoner, an android or an amateur, a ponderer or a
		pragmatist, join me in the infinite mosaic of collective nonsense we can explore.
